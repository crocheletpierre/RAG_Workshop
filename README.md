# MCP Workshop

This is the practical part of the RAG workshop. You will gain a visual understanding of word embedding and something else (still TBD at this point).

## Prerequisites:
If you are using the dev container, everything should be setup for you.
If not, you will need the following:
- python & uv
- python's jupyter ipykernel sdk

## Word Embedding

### Word2Vec

### Doc2Vec

### Task-aware embedder -> instructor large, Qwen3

### Create your own

### Visualization

## Using a RAG with Github Copilot

### Setting up an API Key
Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give it a name like "RAG Workshop"
- Select the copilot scope (this is key!)
- Generate and copy the token


Set the environment variable:\
`export GITHUB_TOKEN='API_KEY'`

### Read through the code

### Fill in the blanks

### Hook it in mcp and use from copilot chat

### Hackaway!
Use the RAG system with your meeting notes, ask an LLM to summarize, analyse sentiments, extract information, connect the dots...
